  <h1>The Finals Boosting FAQ</h1>

  <h2>Is boosting safe?</h2>
  <p>Yes, we use no cheats, no software, and no scripts. Everything is played manually by professional boosters.</p>

  <h2>How long does boosting take?</h2>
  <p>Most boosts are completed within a few hours up to one day depending on your target rank.</p>

  <h2>Do you offer DuoQ/Selfplay?</h2>
  <p>Yes. You can play alongside a booster instead of giving account access.</p>

  <h2>How do I track progress?</h2>
  <p>We update you on Discord or email after major milestones.</p>
